# AdvancedRAG

**A robust hybrid retrieval architecture with grounded generation and hallucination control.**

AdvancedRAG is a custom-built Retrieval-Augmented Generation system focused on factual reliability, structured validation, and measurable confidence scoring.

## Architecture

Adaptive Chunking  
→ Hybrid Retrieval (Dense + Sparse)  
→ Cross-Encoder Re-Ranking  
→ Context Entailment Scoring  
→ Grounded Generation  
→ Citation Mapping  
→ Hallucination Detection  
→ Confidence Scoring  
→ Evaluation Metrics

## Key Features

- Semantic adaptive chunking  
- Weighted hybrid retrieval (FAISS + BM25)  
- Cross-encoder precision re-ranking  
- Entailment-based hallucination detection  
- Citation-backed responses  
- Confidence-scored outputs  
- Wrapper-free implementation

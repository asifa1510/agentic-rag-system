## 🚀 Self-Reflective Agentic 

**Overview** 


A from-scratch multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform featuring task-graph planning, adaptive hybrid retrieval, multi-hop reasoning, self-critique, uncertainty estimation, and long-term memory.  
Unlike traditional RAG pipelines, this system operates as a closed-loop cognitive architecture that dynamically re-plans, retrieves, and verifies before generating final answers.

**Features**  
- Task decomposition using dependency graphs  
- Hybrid retrieval (Vector + BM25 + Knowledge Graph)  
- ReAct / Tree-of-Thought reasoning control  
- Critic agent for hallucination reduction  
- Uncertainty-driven decision mechanism  
- Episodic memory for adaptive strategy learning  

**Deployment**  

```bash

# AdvancedRAG

> Hybrid Retrieval • Grounded Generation • Measurable Reliability

AdvancedRAG is a research-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation architecture built for factual precision and controlled reasoning.

## System Design

- Adaptive semantic chunking  
- Hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse)  
- Cross-encoder re-ranking  
- Context entailment validation  
- Grounded generation  
- Citation-aligned outputs  
- Hallucination detection  
- Confidence scoring  

Built modular, wrapper-free, and evaluation-driven.

# AgenticRAG

> Hybrid Retrieval • Grounded Generation • Agentic Control

AdvancedRAG is a research-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation architecture engineered for factual precision, controlled reasoning, and autonomous decision loops.

## System Design

- Adaptive semantic chunking  
- Hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse)  
- Cross-encoder re-ranking  
- Planner-driven tool selection  
- Iterative reasoning loop  
- Context entailment validation  
- Grounded generation  
- Citation-aligned outputs  
- Hallucination detection  
- Confidence scoring  

Modular. Agentic. Wrapper-free. Evaluation-driven.
